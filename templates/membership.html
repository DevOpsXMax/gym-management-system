            <h2>Choose the Plan That Fits You</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that fitness should fit your life, not the other way around. That's 
                why our 2026 membership options are designed with ultimate flexibility in mind, 
                offering everything from 'no-commitment' monthly plans to all-inclusive premium tiers. 
                Whether you're looking for basic 24/7 facility access, specialized group classes like 
                HIIT and Yoga, or a hybrid experience that includes our on-demand digital workout 
                library, we have a plan tailored to your goals. Every membership includes a 
                personalized orientation and access to our integrated app to track your progress and 
                book recovery sessions with ease. Choose the path that works for you and join a 
                community dedicated to sustainable, long-term wellness.

            <h2>1. The "Longevity & Recovery" Focus</h2>
            <p>
                In 2026, we know that how you recover is just as important as how you train. 
                Our memberships now include dedicated access to our 'Longevity Suite,' featuring 
                infrared saunas, cold plunge therapy, and guided mobility sessions. We believe in 
                training for the long haul, which is why every plan comes with integrated recovery 
                tools designed to reduce inflammation, manage stress, and keep you moving at your 
                best for years to come. It's not just a gym membership; it's an investment in your 
                future self.

            <h2>2. The "Community & Social" Focus</h2>
            <p>
                Fitness is better when shared. At FitnessHub, we prioritize 'Peer Performance'—a 2026 
                movement where progress is fueled by the energy of those around you. Beyond our elite 
                equipment, your membership unlocks a vibrant social ecosystem, including internal run 
                clubs, community events, and social spaces designed for connection. We've replaced 
                'gymtimidation' with high-fives and shared goals, ensuring that while you join for the 
                health benefits, you stay for the friendships.

            <h2>3. The "Smart Data & Hybrid" Focus</h2>
            <p>
                Experience the future of personalized fitness with our Tech-Integrated memberships. 
                Every member gets access to our 2026 'Digital Twin' platform, which uses your wearable 
                data to provide real-time recommendations for your daily workouts and nutrition. 
                Whether you're training in our state-of-the-art facility or using our on-demand app 
                while traveling, your progress remains seamless. We take the guesswork out of your 
                routine, using actionable insights to help you make better decisions for your body 
                every single day."
